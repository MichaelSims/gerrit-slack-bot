# List of event matchers - required
#
# This is a list of matcher definitions for gerrit stream events. Each item in the list has the following properties:
# project - exact match on project OR "*" to match all - required
# branch - exact match on branch OR "*" to match all - required
# subject - regular expression to match on any part of subject (match is case-insensitive) or "*" to match all - required
# isVerificationOnly - boolean to match on comment added events that contain only verification approvals - optional
#     missing or null means match both verifications and non-verifications
#     Note that a verification approval that is accompanied by a code review approval is considered a "non-verification"
#     for the purposes of this test
# changeKind - boolean to match on the "kind" of patch if it is a patchset-created event - optional
#     missing or null means match any change kind
#     commonly used to avoid notifying for trivial rebases or no code changes
# channel - channel to notify - optional. If missing, the event will be dropped (used for filtering unwanted events)
#
# Note that order matters... each event will be matched against each matcher in order and the first match wins.
Event matchers:

# By default no notifications will be sent without removing this matcher! It matches all events and consumes them
# without sending a notification, since the channel property is null (missing)
- project: "*"
  branch: "*"
  subject: "*"

# Drop all commits that start with WIP in the subject
- project: "*"
  branch: "*"
  subject: "^WIP: "

# Drop all verifications... matchers with null/missing channel consume the event without notifying
- project: "*"
  branch: "*"
  subject: "*"
  isVerificationOnly: true

# Send all REWORK commits from feature-branch on project-one to #feature-branch-channel
- project: "project-one"
  branch: "feature-branch"
  subject: "*"
  changeKind: "REWORK"
  channel: "#feature-branch-channel"

# Send all REWORK commits from project-two to #other-channel
- project: "project-two"
  branch: "*"
  subject: "*"
  changeKind: "REWORK"
  channel: "#other-channel"
